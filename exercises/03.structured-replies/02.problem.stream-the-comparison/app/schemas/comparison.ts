 * The shape the model writes into on every comparison turn.
 *
 * Every `.describe(...)` call below ends up inside the JSON Schema the
 * model sees. The model reads those descriptions to decide what each field
 * should contain — so treat them as prompt engineering, not documentation.
 * Be specific about format ("$129", not "the price"), about who decides
 * (the customer's stated criteria, not yours), and about what counts as
 * "good enough" (one or two sentences, at least 2 dimensions, etc.).
 *
 * Constraints (`.min`, `.int`, `.nullable`) are how you tell the model
 * "this field is required to make sense" — an empty array of dimensions
 * is technically valid JSON but useless for a comparison, so we require
 * at least two.
